# Reddit Shorts
This is Reddit Shorts.

A program that automatically fetches reddit posts, then creates a YouTube short content out of it. It is very easy to use, requiring barely any manual work to make the videos. Right now, it can only make 1 video at a time, using only 1 background video and 1 background music. As the program gets updated, it will be more customizable.

# How To Use
Inside of the `src` folder there is a sub-folder: Background. Paste a `background` video (under the name *background.mp4*) and a background music (under the name *music.mp3*). If you plan to upload the video to the internet, please use your own content for the background or a fair-use content you downloaded.

## Example
This is an example of an output video:
